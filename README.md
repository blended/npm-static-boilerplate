# Lightweight Static Site Boilerplate with Less and Hogan. No Grunting. No Gulping.

Firstly, you should go and read [how to use NPM as a build tool][post] by Keith Cirkel.

After that, install the requirements:

    (sudo) npm install -g browserify hashmark less karma parallelshell

We've included some [Google Material](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/bootstrap-elements.html) and Twitter Bootstrap theme, just to show how things work.

Go ahead and start with

    npm run dev
